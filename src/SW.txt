61xx=Command successfully executed; ‘xx’ bytes of data are available and can be requested using GET RESPONSE.
6200=Application has been logically deleted 
6281=The returned data may be erroneous. 
6282=Fewer bytes than specified by the Le parameter could be read, since the end of the file was encountered first.
6283=The selected file is reversibly blocked (invalidated)/Invalid DF
6284=The file control information (FCI) is not structured in accordance with ISO/IEC7816-4.
62xx=Warning; state of non-volatile memory not changed.
6300=Authentification failed. Invalid secret code or forbidden value
6310=More data available 
6381=File filled up by the last write
63Cx=The counter has reached the value ‘x’ (0 = x = 15) (the exact significance depends on the command).
63xx=Warning; state of non-volatile memory changed.
64xx=Execution error; state of non-volatile memory not changed.
6501=Memory failure. There have been problems in writing or reading the EEPROM./Other hardware problems may also bring this error
6581=STATUS_COMMAND_FAILED/Write problem/Memory failure
6591=STATUS_SECURITY_STATUS_NOT_MET
65xx=Execution error; state of non-volatile memory changed.
6700=Wrong length in Lc
6800=Functions in the class byte not supported (general).
6881=Logical channels not supported.
6882=Secure messaging not supported. 
6900=Command not allowed (general)
6981=Command incompatible with file structure.
6982=Security state not satisfied.
6983=Authentication method blocked.
6984=Referenced data reversibly blocked (invalidated).
6985=Usage conditions not satisfied.
6986=Command not allowed (no EF selected)/Incorrect P1 P2
6987=Expected secure messaging data objects missing.
6988=Secure messaging data objects incorrect.
6A00=Incorrect P1 or P2 parameters (general).
6A80=Parameters in the data portion are incorrect.
6A81=Function not supported.
6A82=File not found.
6A83=Record not found.
6A84=Insufficient memory.
6A85=Lc inconsistent with TLV structure
6A86=Incorrect P1 or P2 parameter.
6A87=Lc inconsistent with P1 or P2.
6A88=Referenced data not found.
6B00=Parameter 1 or 2 incorrect.
6Cxx=Bad length value in Le; ‘xx’ is the correct length.
6D00=Command (instruction) not supported. 
6e00=Class not supported.
6f00=Unknown command/Command aborted – more exact diagnosis not possible (e.g., operating system error).
